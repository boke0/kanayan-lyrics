Grab Bag
----
Oh, love, lip, kisses,
dreamy, writing, songs,

oh I gatta easy habit
learn it, move it,
caught up baby,

got it, shopping,
go to movie, all I want,
oh sweet lovely meal

今の life 今の way
I'm like a knife, no way
今のまま or another way
これからの new days

今の life 今の way
I'm gonna go my way
I'm gonna go my way

Grab bag!
Chance is coming to
you once only

Meanwhile you'll know
I am the one and only
Im' strong 切りぬけるわ
hard situations

Life is filled
with glorious so
let's have fun now
(have fun now)

(Dance Dance)
And you just come
with me

(Dance Dance)
Let's dance with me

(Dance Dance)
You can count on me

Life is filled
with glorious
so let's have fun now

Make me laugh now
一緒にいたいんでしょ?
ど ど ど どう?
Hang out!!! 的な

超HAPPY!
でもちょっと待って

冷静に Think about it
上辺着飾ってでも
Is that you? So!

今の life 今の way My
life is like a milky way
今のまま or another way
これからの new days

今の life 今の way
I'm gonna go my way
I'm gonna go my way
