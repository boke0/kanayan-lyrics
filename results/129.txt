In Stereo

It's kinda frightening,
but kinda good.

My body's moving

I feel it coming,

It's in the rhythm,
it's in the mix.

I get a feeling
too good to resist.

I feel it coming,
I feel it coming

Oo-ooh boy hit me in stereo,
Gimme the beat below.

It gets me good, it gets me

Oo-ooh boy

Hit me good, hit me hard,
Turn it up, (up) in stereo.

You can't deny it when it's
